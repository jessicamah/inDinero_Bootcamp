Implement an image carousel from scratch.
=========

An image carousel is a plugin that helps you display multiple images at once and gives you the ability to navigate so you can view the larger version of the image.

Example:

http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/demos/images.html

Requirements:

*  The only allowed plugins are jQuery and underscore.

### Speclist

The image carousel should:
*  Display at least 5 thumbnails (when there are 10 images, display the first 5 then adjust accordingly as you move through the carousel).
*  Have one image (by default the first one) as active and displayed in full view
*  Have navigation buttons that you can press to move through images in the carousel
*  Have the carousel respond to the left and right arrow keys
*  Auto transition to the next image (in 30 seconds by default)
*  When the carousel reaches the last image, it should go back to the first one.
*  Make this a $.function that accepts default parameters like
  * transitions, can be set to any number in seconds or turned off completely
  * bind the navigation to any alphabet key in the keyboard


Bonus points: implementing lazy load on the images :D
