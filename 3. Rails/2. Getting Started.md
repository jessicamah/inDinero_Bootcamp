## Getting Started

###Installing Rails

First off, make sure your machine has rails installed.

For starters, on your terminal run 

> gem install rails

This will install the latest version of the rails gem on your machine.  

If you want to have a specific version of the rails gem, you need to pass the -v option like so:

> gem install rails -v=3.2.19

Once installed (or that you have confirmed that your machine has rails installed), you can now start a new project.

###Creating a new rails project

To create a new project in rails, type:

> rails new <Project Name>

If you need more options, just run the rails new command with the -h flag like so:

> rails new -h

For our purposes, we'll use the project name "BootcampBlog" 

> rails new BootcampBlog -d mysql

Breaking down the command above, this will create a project called BootcampBlog and specify the database adapter as mysql.  We can ommit this and just manually edit the generated file responsible for holding that details for the connection to the database but to make things easier, we use the flag to set it directly to the database that we'll be using.

Once the command completes running you will now have a directory called BootcampBlog in your present working directory.  This contains the whole rails app.  Open this project in your preferred text editor and explore it -- in the case of SublimeText:

> sublime BootcampBlog

Once opened, let's move to the next chapter.
