Active Record Basics

## In this chapter, we will take you through the basics of a database to help you bend it to your will using ActiveRecord

### What is Relational Database?
A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.

### What is Active Record?
Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.

## Getting Started with Active Record Models
### Creating Active Record Models

It is very easy to create Active Record models. All you have to do is to subclass the ActiveRecord::Base class and you're good to go:

Example script:
```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```
or you can just create from the console using the script `rails g model model_name`. Using this script would also generate a migration file which would be discuss later but for now, suppose that products table was already created using an SQL sentence like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
   id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
   name varchar(255),
   description varchar(255),
   PRIMARY KEY  (id)
);
```

As of now, we have created our `Product` model, mapped to a products table at the database with a field name.

## CRUD: Reading and Writing Data
CRUD is an acronym for the four verbs we use to operate on data: Create, Read, Update and Delete. Active Record automatically creates methods to allow an application to read and manipulate data stored within its tables.

### C - Create

Active Record objects can be created from a hash, a block or have their attributes manually set after creation. The new method will return a new object while create will return the object and save it to the database.

In our first example, given our model `Product` with attributes name and description, we will use the `create` method which will create and save a new record into the database automatically:

```ruby
product = Product.create(name:"Phil's Best Juice", description:"made from Philippine Carabao Mangoes")
```
In our next example, again given our model `Product`, we will use the `new` by which an object will be instantiated without being saved:

```ruby
product = Product.new
product.name = "Earl Grey Tea"
product.description = "Full Leaf Black Tea"
```  

A call to `product.save` will commit the record to the database.

### R - Read

Active Record provides a rich API for accessing data within a database. Below are a few examples of different data access methods provided by Active Record.

```ruby
# return a collection of all products
products = Product.all
```

```ruby
# returns the first product found
product = Product.first
```

```ruby
# returns the first product named Earl Grey Tea
product = Product.find_by(name: "Earl Grey Tea")
```

```ruby
# find all products named Phil's Best Juice 
product = Product.where(name: "Phil's Best Juice")
```

### U - Update

Once an Active Record object has been retrieved, its attributes can be modified and it can be saved to the database

```ruby
product = Product.first
product.name = "New and Improve Phil's Best Juice"
product.save
```
A shortcut for this is to use a hash mapping attribute using `update` method

```ruby
product = Product.first
product.update(name:"New Phil's Best Mango Juice")
```
Updating several attributes at once
```ruby
Product.update_all(description: "High Quality Philippine Products")
```

### D - Delete

Likewise, once retrieved an Active Record object can be destroyed which removes it from the database,

```ruby
product = Product.first
product.destroy
```
