Starting with your first Rails Application
=========

Now that we have the rails server up and running, let's start writing some code so you can get a handle on how Rails does things.

First off, let's replace the default Rails page.  You'll be seeing this with every Rails application you create so it'll get old quick.  Let's start things by this simple set of tasks:

1. create a new controller
2. displaying something other than Hello World on the app
3. make this the 'root' url

## Creating a new controller

Creating Rails-specific files can be done in two ways:
1. running the `rails generate` command
2. creating the files manually

Both methods have their pros and cons.  For now let's start with the automated method using the rails command.

> Note:

>  The `rails` command does quite a few things.  If you remember in the last chapter, we started our server using `rails server`.  

>  To get a complete list of commands that you can do with rails, just run `rails` in the command line without any arguments.

>  For help regarding any commands chained with `rails` just type `rails <command> --help`

To create our controller, we simply run: `rails generate controller Welcome`

This will generate a controller named welcome_controller.rb with WelcomeController declared inside in it.  Note the naming convention as this will help you differential a controller, a helper, a model, etc.

The alternative to running the command of course is to create this manually via our text editor.

The pros for command line generation?  Speed.  It gives us a simple shortcut to create files with using rails convention without thinking much about it.  There's also a lot of options available for us to make things creation easier like automatically creating controllers with additional methonds, etc.  Feel free to experiment with the `rails generate controller` as you see fit :D.

The downside of course is that it's only useful during creation :|.

As for creating this manually, it's just important to follow convention:

> some_controller.rb

> class SomeController > ApplicationController

> end

For our purposes, a controller extends the ApplicationController class which gives us a bunch of methods useful for handling requests.  In ruby, we can have our classes any name we want but in Rails, we usually get a warning message when we don't follow conventions.

Now that we have a controller for our Rails application, the next question is what does the controller do exactly?  If you've read about the concept of MVC, the controller is responsible for handling requests from the client.  Usually, you have one controller to manage the requests for a specific area of your application (this is not true in some cases but we won't cover that for now).

The controller alone won't work (verify this) because the rails application doesn't know know how to route things yet so we'll have to manually configure this first.

## The router

Open up the file config/routes.rb

As described above, we still need to wire up our application so rails so that can properly point the request to the proper controller.  The router is basically a map of our application that's navigable via requests.
