## Introduction

### What is a shell?

The shell accepts input from the standard input and prints results to the standard output.
It accesses the operating system's services. Most of the time, when we say shell, we refer
to command line interface shells. This means that we type in to the keyboard the command we wish
to run in the shell prompt (usually a % or $) and wait for the OS to do something,
until we see the shell prompt again, meaning we can type in the next command.

### What is a terminal?

A terminal basically allows the user to access the shell.

#### Terminal.app and iTerm2.app

In OSX, there is an application called `Terminal.app`.
This is a very basic terminal application which is the only thing you need.
You can open `Terminal` by typing in `Terminal` in Spotlight or running the `Terminal.app` from Finder in the `Applications` folder.

There is also a popular alternative to `Terminal.app` called `iTerm2`. `iTerm2` has some very handy features,
like splitting panes vertically and horizontally, as well as sending keystrokes to all panes. Most of the time though,
`Terminal.app` is good enough. You can download iTerm2 [here](http://iterm2.com/).

## Navigation

When you launch the terminal app, you normally go to your user's `$HOME` directory.

### `pwd`

To know the current working directory, type `pwd`.

#### Paths

The system is made up of files and directories. We access the files and directories with their path.
For example, the `pwd` would display `/Users/inDinero`. This is an absolute path. `Users` is a directory under the
the `/`, which is the root path, while `inDinero` is another directory inside `Users`.

`.` means the current path, while `..` the parent of the path.

### `ls`

To list the files and directories of the current working directory, use the `ls` shell command.
The output returned to the user will change depending on the argument the user gives to the `ls` command.

#### Anatomy of the shell command

```
$                  ls          -al           .
^ command prompt   ^ command   ^ argument    ^ another argument
```

#### Continuing on `ls`

Here's an example of the output of `ls`:

```
$ ls -alh
