# Introduction To Programming (Duration: 1 week)
## Basic Programming Knowledge (Maynard)
### 1. Data source and storage
#### Literals
Literals are data/values that are hard coded in the source file. Examples are number (`3`), string (`"hello"`), array (`[1,2,3]`) and hash (`{ :key => 'value' }`) literals.

In this code,
` x = 5 `,
the value of `x` is *literally* `5`. Compare that to
` x = y `,
where the value of x is **not** literally `y`, but what the value of `y` is. That's because `y` is not a literal (it could be a method or variable)

#### Variables
Variables are used to store values for later reference. Since **Ruby** is a *loosely typed* language, you can assign any data type to a variable.

```
x = 123
x = "hello"
x = { :key => value }
x = [1, 2, 3]
```

In Ruby, a variable is *defined* the moment that it is *passed* in the code (not necessarily executed or assigned a value). Variables have an initial value of `nil` until they are assigned a different value.

```
> puts abc
NameError: undefined local variable or method `abc' for main:Object
> if false
>   abc = 123
> end
> puts abc # abc == nil, and nil is printed as emptry string

> abc = 234
> puts abc
234
```

#### methods
Methods are sets of expressions that return a value. They are commonly used for abstraction, isolation and reuse of code.

### 2. Data transformation
#### Math Stuff (for numbers)
#### Content Transformation (for strings, hashes, arrays, etc.)
#### Form Transformation (for others like hash to pdf)

### 3. Data persistence and retrieval
#### persistence / saving
#### retrieval

### 4. Data presentation
#### printing to console
#### generating / displaying web pages
#### creating files

## Ruby Introduction
### 1. Data structures (Maynard)
#### Arrays
#### Dictionaries (i.e. Hashtables)
#### Trees
#### Enums
  
### 2. Variable Scoping (Maynard)
#### Global ($)
#### Class (@@)
#### Instance (@)
#### Local (within methods, blocks and loops)

### 3. Conditionals (Jayson)
#### If Else
if expressions are used for conditional execution. The values false and nil are false, and everything else are true. Notice Ruby uses elsif, not else if nor elif.

Executes code if the conditional is true. If the conditional is not true, code specified in the else clause is executed.
```
> num = 2
> # if syntax
> if num % 2 == 0
> puts "2 is even"
> end
2 is even

> # if else syntax
> x=1
> if x>2
>  puts "x is less than 2"
> else
>  puts "x is greater than 2"
> end
x is less than 2

> #elsif syntax
> number = -5
> if number % 2 == 0
>   puts "#{number} is an even number"
> elsif number < 0
    puts "#{number} is a negative number"
> else
>   puts "#{number} is an odd number"
> end
-5 is a negative number
```

#### Unless
Executes code if conditional is false. If the conditional is true, code specified in the else clause is executed.
```
> # unless syntax
> allowed_person = ["Lebron", "Carmelo", "Durant"]
> unless allowed_person.include?("Robin Williams")
>   puts "You are not a NBA superstar"
> else
>   puts "Welcome bruh"
> end
You are not a NBA superstar
```

### 4. Loops and Iterators (Jayson)

###Why Loop?
Just imagine you needed a program to do something 10 times. You could copy and paste the code 10 times, not to mention slow and pointless. Or, you could tell the computer to repeat a bit of code between point A and point B, until the time comes that you need it to stop. Such a thing is called a loop.

#### Loops
Loops in Ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times.

#### Loop
It is the simpliest form of loop in ruby.

```
> 5.times { puts "Foo" }
Foo
Foo
Foo
Foo
Foo

> loop { puts "Hello World" } #produces infinite loop
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
...
```

#### While Loop
Executes the passed code block repeatedly while the condition is satisfied. 
```
> i = 0
> while i < 5 do
>   puts "Hello Phillipines"
>   i += 1
> end
Hello Phillipines
Hello Phillipines
Hello Phillipines
Hello Phillipines
Hello Phillipines
```

#### Until Loop
The code block is repeatedly executed until the condition is satisfied.
```
> cnt = 0
> until cnt > 5 do
>   puts "Number: #{cnt}"
>   cnt += 1
> end
Number: 0
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```



#### Each
Calls the given block once for each element in self and pass its element as a parameter.
```
> #for Arrray
> friends = ["Maynard", "Julian", "Emmanuel"]
> friends.each{|friend| puts "My Friend #{friend}."}
My Friend Maynard.
My Friend Julian.
My Friend Emmanuel.
=> ["Maynard", "Julian", "Emmanuel"]

> #for Hash
> hash = {brand: "suzuki", model: "alto", color: "red"}
> hash.each do |key, value|
>  puts "#{key}: #{value}"
> end
brand: suzuki
model: alto
color: red
=> {:brand=>"suzuki", :model=>"alto", :color=>"red"}
```

#### Each with index
Same as #each, but passes the index of the element instead of the element itself.

```
> #for Arrray
> array1 = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
> array1.each_index {|elem| puts "#{elem} --" }
0 --
1 --
2 --
=> ["a", "b", "c"]


```

#### Select
Returns a new array containing all elements of ary for which the given block returns a true value.
```
> #for Arrray
> num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7]
> even_num = num_array.select
=> [2, 4]
> puts even_num
2
4
=> nil

> #Hash
> h = {d: 1, c: 2, l: 3}
> h.select{|s, k| k.even?}
=> {:c=>2}
```

#### Map
Invokes the given block once for each element of self. Creates a new array containing the values returned by the block.
```ruby
> num_arr = [1,2,3]
> num_arr.map {|x| x + 1 }
#=> [2,3,4]
> puts num_arr
1
2
3
=> nil
> num_arr.map! {|x| x + 1 } #eager loading, the changes will apply to each element of the array
=> [2, 3, 4]
> puts num_arr
2
3
4
=> nil
```
#### Break
Causes unconditional termination of a code block or while or until block, with control transfered to the line after the block. If given an argument, returns that argument as the value of the terminated block.
```
> i = 5
> while i > 0 do
>  puts "Print me Thrice"
>  if i == 3
>    break
>  else
>    i -= 1
>  end
> end
Print me Thrice
Print me Thrice
Print me Thrice
=> nil
```

#### Next
Bumps an iterator, or a while or until block,to the next iteration, unconditionally and without executing whatever may remain of the block.
```
> num_array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
> num_array.each do |num|
>   if num.even?
>     next
>   else
>     puts num
>   end
> end
1
3
5
7
9
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

end
end
